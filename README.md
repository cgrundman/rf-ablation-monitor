## Cardiac Arrhythmia

Cardiac Arrhythmia is a condition where the heart beat takes an irregular step. It is caused by fatty tissue present in the heart.

Heart beats are triggered by electrical signal from the sinus nerve. The signal travels through the heart and triggers contractions in the different chamber of the heart to pump blood through the body.

The signal originates from the Sinus node. From the sinus node, it travels through the Atrium (causing the Atriums to contract) to the Atrioventricular (AV) Node. The signal then continues through the vetricals causing contraction there. From here the signal travels back towards the Atriums, where there is a refractory period in the heart muscle preventing the signal from activating another contraction before dissipation.

The heartbeat can be further visualized by an ECG. PQ is contraction and relaxation of atriums, QRS is the contraction of the ventricals, and ST represents relaxation of the ventrical.

However when there is sufficient fatty tissue, the impedence of the tissue rises and delays signal propagation. If the delay lasts longer than the refractory period, the signal triggers another contraction of the ventricals. The ECG then shows another ventrical contraction after the first. The following image shows a normal heartbeat above, and a heartbeat with arrhythmia lies below.
