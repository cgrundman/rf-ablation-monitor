## Cardiac Arrythmia

Fundamentals of Arrythmia and typical treatments

Cardiac Arrythmia is a condition where the heart beat takes an irregular step. It is caused by fatty tissue present in the heart.

Heart beats are triggered by electrical signal from the sinus nerve. The signal travels through the heart and triggers contractions in the different chamber of the heart to pump blood through the body.

The signal originates from the Sinus node. From the sinus node ot travels through the Atrium (causing the Atriums to contract) to the Atrioventricular (AV) Node. The signal then continues through the vetricals causing contraction there. From here the signal travels back towards the Atriums, where there is a refractory period preventing another contraction.

However when there is sufficient fatty tissue, the impedence of the tissue rises and delays signal propagation. If the delay lasts longer than the refractory period, the signal triggers another contraction.
